# Weather Guessing App

## Introduction
Welcome to Guess The Weather - an engaging and interactive weather guessing app developed for the Nillion Tinybin bounty challenge! This app allows users to predict the next day's temperature in Goa and compare their guess with the actual temperature retrieved from a weather API. It also showcases secure data comparison using Nillion's Nada programs, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the results.

## Features
- Weather Guessing: Users input their temperature guess for Tokyo, and the app fetches the actual temperature using a weather API.
